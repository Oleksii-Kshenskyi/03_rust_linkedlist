# Rust Linked List

This repo contains a simple (singly) linked list implementation in Rust. There are no special restrictions or conditions imposed on the implementation, it's simply for the sake of learning: I've never implemented a data structure in Rust and I'd like to see how the implementation would look like in this language.
